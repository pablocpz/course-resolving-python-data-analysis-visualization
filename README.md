# Resolving Python for Data Visualization

This repository contains the exercises you'll work during the course "Resolving Python for Analysis Data Visualization".

You may use the exercises to practice on your own; challenges and datasets are provided.

Within every folder, you will find 2 types of Jupyter Notebooks:

- A: Blank notebook to be completed after you watch the respective tutorial of the [digital course](https://courses.resolvingpython.com/).
- C: Blank notebook to be completed as a homework.
- B & D files are the solutions to notebooks A & C, respectively.

❌ If you copy-paste the solutions, you will not learn anything.

✅ **It is very important you work on the notebooks as we explain in the [digital course](https://courses.resolvingpython.com/) to acquire the mental models and the skills you will use in any other data project.**

If you want to showcase your work on this course as a portfolio, don't forget to [fork this repository](https://github.com/jsulopzs/course-resolving-python-data-visualization/fork) to create a copy on your profile.
